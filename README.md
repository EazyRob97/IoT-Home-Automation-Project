# IoT Home Automation Project

Until now there have been many videos roaming around about IoT Smart-Home Devices controlling Appliances around the house and it caught my attention. Therefore I wanted to design my own simulation of a Smart IoT Device in use for Home Automation. There have also been several tutorial videos regarding controlling appliances over internet. And for that Blynk has been a preference as it was easy to use and user friendly also according to some research. But all those things were based on internet. That means we can control appliances only when we have proper internet connection otherwise that wont work at all.

The Project that I'm going to propose is a Home Automation Based Lamp accompanied with a Relay over a Server using a Raspberry Pi & Blynk App. Iâ€™m also going to be using a PIR Sensor. Code for this project will be written in Javascript and will be uploaded on my GitHub in due course.


# Components Required:
